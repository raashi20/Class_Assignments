        <p>Internet is one of the most creative and popular inventions in the history of the world. It has efficiently opened up the possibilities of further advancements in many other fields of existence. It has made our lives convenient and has also made the world look smaller to us. Internet allows us to access the information displayed on various websites. These websites who display and add information to the internet have to follow certain set protocols for ensuring cyber safety.
            Internet opens up the possibility of various activities such as accessing almost all the books across the world, connecting with people across oceans, providing education even in the remote areas, paying bills while sitting in the comfort of our homes, shopping for anything at just the click of a button, ordering food quickly, learning whatâ€™s going around the world and more. Searching information on the internet is a quick business and is very convenient.</p>
        <p>Internet was created by ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network). The development of internet was originally funded by the U.S. and was started in 1960s. Since then the advances in internet have been tremendous. Various scientists have developed internet protocols to set standards about how the information should be transferred by the medium of internet.
            The World Wide Web (www) developed by Tim Berners Lee is a platform for accessing information on the internet stored in various websites and web pages. Various other data scientists enhanced the working and concepts of internet by applying various principles of science and technology. Hence, the internet has developed to a more elaborate and advanced system than the one which was just invented in the 60s. Further, proper and controlled research on this front can produce fascinating results and solve many of our unsolved problems with ease and efficiency.</p>
